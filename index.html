		<p> No Face is a spirit who tries to conform to the bathhouse society in Spirited Away. He communicates through a series of moans and sounds. At first, in the movie Spirited Away, No Face is seen as a neutral protagnist. Eventually, he becomes corrupted and becomes a pseudo-antagonist, before reverting to his previous state and accompanying Chihiro in her journey. </p>
